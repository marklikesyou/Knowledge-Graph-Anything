The Early Era of Video Games (1940s-1970s)

The history of video games begins in the 1940s when computer scientists began designing simple games and simulations on mainframe computers. In 1947, Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann created what is considered the first interactive electronic game, the "Cathode-Ray Tube Amusement Device."

The first widely recognized video game was "Tennis for Two," created by William Higinbotham in 1958 at Brookhaven National Laboratory. This simple tennis simulation was displayed on an oscilloscope and allowed two players to compete against each other.

In 1962, Steve Russell at MIT created "Spacewar!" on a PDP-1 computer. This was the first computer game that could be played on multiple computer installations. The game featured two spaceships battling each other while dealing with the gravitational pull of a central star.

The first commercial arcade video game, Computer Space, was released in 1971 by Nutting Associates. However, it was Atari's PONG, released in 1972, that truly launched the commercial video game industry. Created by Allan Alcorn under the direction of Nolan Bushnell, PONG became the first commercially successful video game.

By the mid-1970s, the foundation of the video game industry had been established, setting the stage for the golden age of arcade games that would follow.
